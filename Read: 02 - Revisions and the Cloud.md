* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: allows the user to interact with the system using graphical elements such as windows, icons, menus

* **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: allows the user to interact with the system using command and those commands you can write using terminterminal.

### And some of these system commands that can be used:

* ls : will list for me directories(folders) and files (That are not hidden)   
  
* ls -la : List all files (with hidden ones)--

* cd (Change Directory) : to open a certain directory(folder), example: cd test -> here I want to open a directory called test

* cd ..  : to go back from my current directory(folder) to the previous one -> if I'm in the test directory and want to go back to the previous one (let's assume it's called testPrevious) then I just type cd ..

* mkdir :(Make directory) to create a directory(folder) -> mkdir newTest , here I now have a new directory called newTest
Directory is a Folder and this folder will have the Files of my project, so if I want to create a file I use:

* touch command, and don't forget the extension of the file, example touch index.html will create an HTML file

* pwd (Print Working Directory) : to see where I am now

* clear : clears the terminal
