### Chapter 16: “Images”:

* Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

* To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

## Video and Audio APIs:

* **The &lt;video> and &lt;audio>** elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. the most interesting attribute is **(controls)**, which enables the default set of playback **controls**. If you don't specify this, you get no playback **controls**.

* This is not as immediately useful for video playback, but it does have advantages. 

* **One big issue with the native browser controls is:** that they are different in each browser — not very good for cross-browser support! **Another big issue is:** that the native controls in most browsers aren't very keyboard-accessible.

* **You can solve both these problems by:** hiding the native controls (by removing the controls attribute), and programming your own with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
