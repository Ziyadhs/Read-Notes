# growth mindset 📈 🧠

 After reading about **Growth Mindset** in my opinion it is not about being genius or being talented, but it is about the effort and the hard work that you put in something to gain new knowledge, achieve your goals, or even learning a new skill that will help you in future, without saying that you can't be like others because they are talented but you are not. Of course talent can help but even talented people need to work hard to keep that talent or they will lose it over the time.
 
  And to keep that in my mind I just do the following:
 
  1. First thing keep reminding myself about the goal that I want to achieve 
  2. Second thing is keep saying that I **can** instead of I <s> can't </s>
  3. Third thing is to remind myself about other people success stories who never give up and kept their hard work until they succeeded in thier life at the end and achieved their goals
  
  here is a link about some of these success stories

  And here is one of my favorite quotes that keep reminding me that even you fail that doesn't matter, actually it will teach you a new thing to make your next try better
