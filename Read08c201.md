### Chapter 15: “Layout”: (repeat of Class 4 reading)

* &lt;div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
