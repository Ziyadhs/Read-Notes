### Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links”:

* Links are created using the &lt;a> element.

* The &lt;a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

* You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.

* You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

### Chapter 15: “Layout”:

* &lt;div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

### Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects”:

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.

* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.

### How does pair programming work?

**Pair programming generally has two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.**

1. **The Driver:** is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.

2. **The Navigator:** uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

### Why pair program?

1. **Greater efficiency:** when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own. Also, when the pair is stuck, both programmers can research the problem and reach a solution faster.

2. **Engaged collaboration:** when two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. 

3. **Learning from fellow students:** everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

4. **Social skills:** pair programming is great for improving social skills. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills.

5. **Job interview readiness:** for most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.

6. **Work environment readiness:** many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
