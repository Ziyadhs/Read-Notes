### Chapter 3: “Object Literals” from p100-p105 :

* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.

* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

### Chapter 5: “Document Object Model”:

* The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.

* DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

* You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

* Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadelist.

* From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.

* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.

* In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).

* Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
