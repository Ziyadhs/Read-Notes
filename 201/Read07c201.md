* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the &lt;tr> element.

* Inside each row there are a number of cellsrepresented by the &lt;td> element (or &lt;th> if it is a header).

* You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

* For long tables you can split the table into a &lt;thead>, &lt;tbody>, and &lt;tfoot>.

## Domain Modeling:

* **Domain Modeling:** is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
