### Chapter 1: “Structure”:

* HTML pages are text documents.

* HTML use tags that are often referred to element.

* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

* tags come in to two types.

 1. Paired and Unpaired Tags.
 2. Self-Closing Tags.

* and to learn HTML you need to know what tags you can use in HTML and how to use it.

### Chapter 8: “Extra Markup”:

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you.
are using.

* to add comment in HTML you need to use (&lt;!-- comment -->).

* id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

* The &lt;div> and &lt;span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.

* &lt;iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

* &lt;meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

### Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout”:

* HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple &lt;div> elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

### Chapter 18: “Process & Design”:

* It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* we use Site maps to allow us to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

* Design is about communication. you have to make sure that the Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

### JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming”:

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.

* To approach writing a script break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

* Computers create models of the world using data.

* The models use objects to represent physical things. Objects can have: properties that tell us about the object; methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object; events which are triggeredwhen a user interacts with the computer.

* Web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page. Each element creates its own a (which is a kind of object).

* Programmers can write code to say " When this eventoccurs, run that code ".

* To make web pages interactive, you write code that
uses the browser's model of the web page.

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

* The HTML &lt;script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the &lt;link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
