### Chapter 2: “Text”:

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

* HTML elemnts also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

### Chapter 10: “Introducing CSS”:

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Summary for some Duckett JS book chapters:

### Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions”:

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

* Scripts contain very precise instructions.

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

* Expressions evaluate into a single value.

* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

### Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops”: (only up to the section on switch statements)

* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.

* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
