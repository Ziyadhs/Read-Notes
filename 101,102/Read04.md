**JavaScript**: is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, etc.

### What JAVASCRIPT can do?

* Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.
* Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".
* Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.

### Some data types in JAVASCRIPT
 
 * numbers =>1 2 -2 0.4 
 
 * string => 'anuthing' or "ahmad"
  
 * Boolean =>  true / false 

 ### operators
