# About markdown

I learned that markdown language is a language that web writers use to right texts on the web with the ability of controlling how the text style will be, it doesn't require from the user to know any other languages to use it liks CSS or HTML or any programming languages like java script.

With it's syntax you can change the text style for example make the text **bold** or *italic* or allow you to add links or images, and the files extension of markdown file is .md or .markdown.

# About github

It is a really helpful website it help you to store your projects in it without worrying about losing anything because of any issue you might face on your pc. Also you can show these projects to other people or make these projects private and you can edit these projets online without downloading the files to edit it.

It is also great for teams who want to work on one project, instead of having too many copies of the same project and merging all the work you can easily add your team and give them access to edit that project so in that way all the project will be in one file and if there is any problem you can just edit it online or anyone from your team can do that.
