# nosql vs sql

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

 If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

data from molecular modeling, Geo-spatial information, and satellite data are highly unstructured. Likewise, data from social media analysis and websites is also highly unstructured, and relationships among the data entities are not clearly defined. In such scenarios, NoSQL is a better choice.

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
