### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

**Mounting:** When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

### Put the following things in the order that they happen:(componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates)

1- constructor

2- componentDidMount

3- render

4- componentDidMount

5- componentWillUnmount

### What does componentDidMount do?

**componentDidMount:** This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
