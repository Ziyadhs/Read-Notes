# React Docs - lists and keys

### What does .map() return?

The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order and it return a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.

### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

we loop through the values inside the array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a &lt;li> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems

### Each list item needs a unique __(Key)__.



### What is the purpose of a key?

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed

# The Spread Operator

### What is the spread operator?

**spread operator:** is a new addition to the set of operators in JavaScript ES6. It takes in an iterable (e.g an array) and expands it into individual elements and it is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS objects. Using this operator makes the code concise and enhances its readability.

### List things that the spread operator can do.

thehe spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JavaScript, including the following:

1- Copying an array

2- Concatenating or combining arrays

3- Using Math functions

4- Using an array as arguments

5- Adding an item to a list

6- Adding to state in React

7- Combining objects

8- Converting NodeList to an array

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

**Example:**

const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]

const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]

const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]

console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

### Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

**Example:**

const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']

const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]

console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

**Example:**

const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}

const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}

const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}

console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }

const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}

objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
