# Functional Programming Concepts

### What is functional programming?

**Functional programming:** is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:

1- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)

2- It does not cause any observable side effects

### What are the benefits of a pure function?

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

* Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
 
* Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D

### What is immutability?

**immutability:** Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

### What is Referential transparency?

Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

**pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency**
